Still need to make sure the following gets completed:
  - test host setup
    - block device of $X size (allow to specify)
    - Allow customization of number of test hosts.
  - Get a version of checkServer running
    - We'll determine how restrictive we want to getlater.
    - check for presence permatest kernel module
    - Generate /etc/required_packages
  - Set up variables to allow the user to tweak things.
    - Git repo location of perforce tree
    - Alternate location of RPM repository containing permabit-rsvpd,
      athena-athinfod, etc.
  - Detect OS version
    - rhel vs fedora
      - dnf vs yum
  - Install missing pieces:
    - Missing "something" (still needs investigation to resolve)
      - /permabit/release doesn't exist.  Will this be a problem?
        - Yes, but in the  meantime we can specify UDS_TOP

- On the resource server:
  - Tasks:
    - Copy /permabit/build/{tools,perl,python} locations to the NFS locations
      for lastrun usage on the clients

- On the client:
  - Tasks:
    - Mount NFS locations:
      - /home/nightly - 'nightly' homedir
      - /permabit/not-backed-up
      - /permabit/build/perl
      - /permabit/build/python
      - /permabit/build/tools
      - Add those NFS mounts to /etc/fstab
    - Establish ssh host keys between the hosts so that resource-vagrant can SSH to vagrant-farm
    - Find out how to persist vdo_scratch symlink across reboots.
      - afarms currently have a udev rule to do this, which we can't rely on for this purpose.
